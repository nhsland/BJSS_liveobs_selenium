Data Entry Page
===============
The Data Entry Page allows the user to enter data for the observation or
escalation task they are doing. It has a floating header that allows the user
to access information on the patient while filling out the form.

The page will have some inputs if needed to complete the form but this is not
always the case however there will always be at least one button that will
allow the user to complete or cancel the task they are doing.
