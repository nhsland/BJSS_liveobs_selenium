Login Page
==========
The login page is the first page that mobile users see when they use LiveObs,
they are prompted to enter their username and password (either supplied to
them by a more privileged user or via LDAP).

For test and development purposes there may be multiple databases running on
the one LiveObs instances, if this is the case then there will be a dropdown
that allows for the selection of the database to log into.
